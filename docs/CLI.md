# aibot robot CLI reference

*As of 2026-10-27.*

## Getting started

The robot talks at 921600 baud since M3; the CLI uses that by default.

Run the CLI from `firmware/`, type a command at the prompt and press Enter. It prints only the robot's replies.

```bash
cd firmware
pip install -r tools/requirements.txt   # first time only
python3 tools/robot_cli.py /dev/ttyACM0
```

- Plug into the board's **COM** port, not the one marked USB. It shows up as `/dev/ttyACM0`.
- Close `idf.py monitor` first. Only one program can hold the port at a time.
- Ctrl-D or Ctrl-C quits.

| Option          | Default  | What it does                         |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `port`        | required | Serial device, e.g. `/dev/ttyACM0` |
| `--baud`      | 921600   | Serial speed                         |
| `--logs`      | off      | Show ESP_LOG lines from the firmware |
| `--telemetry` | off      | Show the periodic telemetry stream   |

Options go before the port: `python3 tools/robot_cli.py --telemetry /dev/ttyACM0`.

## Reading the output

Every command gets exactly one reply line, shown as `[type] {fields}`. An `ack` means it worked; an `error` says what went wrong.

```
expr happy
[ack] {"cmd": "expr", "name": "happy"}
expr hapy
[error] {"msg": "usage: expr <neutral|happy|sad|angry|surprised|sleepy|listening|thinking>"}
```

| Type          | When you see it                                                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ack`       | A command succeeded. `cmd` names it; other fields are its result                                           |
| `error`     | Bad arguments, unknown command, or hardware not ready                                                        |
| `pong`      | Reply to `ping`                                                                                            |
| `telemetry` | Reply to `status`, or every second with `--telemetry`                                                    |
| `boot`      | The board just started: `reset_reason`, `idf` version, and whether the `pca9685`, `lcd`, `audio` and `mic` are ready |
| `i2cscan`   | Reply to `i2cscan`                                                                                         |

Under the hood the robot sends one JSON object per line. Commands are plain text, one per line.

## System commands

| Command       | What it does                                                               | Reply                                                             |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ping`      | Checks the board is alive                                                  | `[pong] {"uptime_ms": …}`                                      |
| `status`    | Prints one telemetry line now                                              | `[telemetry] up 61.3s  heap …  internal …  psram …  tasks 8  fps 30 (drawn 2)  frame 14.8ms  audio 0ms  dropouts 0  mic peak 0.000  overruns 0` |
| `rate <ms>` | Sets the telemetry period, 100 to 60000 ms. Back to 1000 ms after a reboot | `[ack] {"cmd": "rate", "period_ms": …}`                        |
| `reboot`    | Restarts the board                                                         | `[ack] {"cmd": "reboot"}`, then a `boot` line                 |

Telemetry fields: uptime, free heap, lowest free heap since boot, free internal RAM, free PSRAM, task count, and the display: `fps` is the animation rate (30), `drawn` is how many frames were actually redrawn (low while the face is still, up to 30 during blinks and moves), and `frame` is the time to draw one frame (about 15 ms at 80 MHz SPI). `audio` is how much sound is queued, and `dropouts` counts the times audio ran out mid-stream since boot (should stay 0).

## Face and display commands

The board shows the neutral face (two eyes and a mouth) at boot and animates it at 30 fps: it blinks every 2 to 6 seconds (sometimes twice), glances around every 1 to 4 seconds, and blends into a new expression over about 200 ms.

### Expressions: `expr <name>`

| Command | Eyes | Mouth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `expr neutral` | Rounded rectangles, the boot face | Small, slightly upturned line |
| `expr happy` | Upward crescents | Wide smile |
| `expr sad` | Lids droop toward the outer corners | Frown |
| `expr angry` | Lids slant down toward the center | Slight frown, thicker |
| `expr surprised` | Bigger, rounder eyes | Small round "o" |
| `expr sleepy` | Half-closed, flat top | Tiny flat line |
| `expr listening` | Slightly larger and raised | Small, slightly open |
| `expr thinking` | One eye squints, looking up and right | Small frown, off to one side |
| `expr` | Lists the names | |

Reply: `[ack] {"cmd": "expr", "name": "happy"}`.

### Eyes and animation

| Command | What it does | Reply |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `look <x> <y>` | Points the eyes. x is -1 (left) to 1 (right), y is -1 (up) to 1 (down). Stops idle eye movement | `[ack] {"cmd": "look", "x": 0.80, "y": -0.50, "auto": false}` |
| `blink` | Blinks once now | `[ack] {"cmd": "blink"}` |
| `eyes auto on` | Turns idle blinking and eye movement back on, e.g. after `look` | `[ack] {"cmd": "eyes", "auto": true}` |
| `eyes auto off` | Holds the eyes still: no random blinks or glances. `blink` and `look` still work | `[ack] {"cmd": "eyes", "auto": false}` |
| `eyes` | Shows whether idle animation is on | `[ack] {"cmd": "eyes", "auto": …}` |
| `talk on` | Flaps the mouth in random syllables, as if speaking. A stand-in until real speech drives it | `[ack] {"cmd": "talk", "on": true}` |
| `talk off` | Stops after the current syllable | `[ack] {"cmd": "talk", "on": false}` |

Idle animation is on at every boot.

### Screen controls

| Command                    | What it does                                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bright <0-100>`         | Sets backlight brightness in %. `bright` alone shows it. Boot default is 80                               |
| `lcdtest [image]`        | Test image: `pattern` (default), or solid `red`, `green`, `blue`, `white`, `black`. Pauses the face until the next `expr`, `look`, `blink` or `eyes` command |
| `lcdcfg`                 | Shows the orientation and color settings                                                                    |
| `lcdcfg <setting> <0\|1>` | Changes `invert`, `mirror_x`, `mirror_y` or `swap_rb`, then redraws the pattern. Lasts until reboot |

The test pattern should show a red dot at the top, green on the right, blue at the bottom, a white dot in the center and a white ring at the edge, on black. Permanent orientation and color changes go in `idf.py menuconfig` under *aibot display*.

## Sound commands

| Command | What it does | Reply |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `beep` | Plays an 880 Hz tone for 300 ms | `[ack] {"cmd": "beep", "hz": 880, "ms": 300}` |
| `beep <hz> <ms>` | Plays a tone, 50 to 8000 Hz, 10 to 2000 ms | same |
| `vol <0-100>` | Sets the speaker volume in %. `vol` alone shows it. Boot default is 50 | `[ack] {"cmd": "vol", "percent": 50}` |
| `pcm …` | Used by `say.py` to stream audio. Not meant for typing | `[pcm] {"buffered": …, "capacity": 32768, "dropped": 0}` |
| `mic` | Shows whether the mic is streaming, and its gain | `[ack] {"cmd": "mic", "on": false, "gain_db": 18}` |
| `mic on` / `mic off` | Starts or stops streaming the mic to the PC, one `mic` line per 20 ms. The CLI hides those lines; use `record.py` to save them | same |
| `mic gain <0-40>` | Sets the mic gain in dB. Boot default is 18. Loud speech close to the mic can clip; `record.py` warns when it does | same |

### Speech from the PC: `say.py`

Close the CLI first, then:

```bash
python3 tools/say.py /dev/ttyACM0 "Hello, I'm aibot."
python3 tools/say.py /dev/ttyACM0 --wav clip.wav        # play a 16-bit WAV file
python3 tools/say.py /dev/ttyACM0 "Hi" --save hi.wav    # also keep the audio that was sent
```

It makes the speech on the PC with Piper (voice `en_US-lessac-medium`, downloaded to `tools/voices/` on first use, about 60 MB), streams it at 16 kHz, and the mouth moves with the sound. It ends with a line like `played 2.9 s in 3.1 s, robot dropouts since boot: 0`.

### Recording on the PC: `record.py`

Close the CLI first, then:

```bash
python3 tools/record.py /dev/ttyACM0                     # 5 s into mic.wav
python3 tools/record.py /dev/ttyACM0 -s 10 -o hello.wav  # 10 s into hello.wav
python3 tools/record.py /dev/ttyACM0 --gain 30           # set the mic gain first
```

It shows a live level bar while recording, then a summary like `recorded 5.0 s, 0 blocks missing (gaps)` and `peak -12.3 dBFS, average -35.0 dBFS, 0 clipped samples`. It warns if the audio is all zeros (mic not wired), clipped (lower `--gain`) or very quiet (raise it). Play a recording on the robot with `say.py --wav`.

## Servo commands (M7, not yet tested)

These work once a PCA9685 is wired up. Without one, every command except `i2cscan` replies `pca9685 not found, check wiring and run i2cscan`.

| Command                  | What it does                                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `i2cscan`              | Lists I2C devices in decimal. A PCA9685 shows as 64 (0x40), plus 112 (0x70)                            |
| `servo <joint> <deg>`  | Moves a joint straight to an angle, clamped to its limits. Reply includes `pulse_us` and `clamped` |
| `pulse <channel> <us>` | Raw pulse, 500 to 2500 µs, on any of the 16 channels. For calibration; ignores joint limits           |
| `relax [joint]`        | Stops pulses so the servo goes limp. No joint relaxes all                                              |

| Joint          | Index | Channel | Limits (placeholder) |
| -------------- | ----- | ------- | -------------------- |
| `body_yaw`   | 0     | 0       | −90° to 90°       |
| `head_yaw`   | 1     | 1       | −60° to 60°       |
| `head_pitch` | 2     | 2       | −20° to 30°       |

A joint can be given by name or index: `servo head_yaw 30` and `servo 1 30` do the same thing.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                                          | Likely cause                       | Fix                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No reply, or garbled replies                     | Another program holds the port     | Close `idf.py monitor` and other CLIs. `fuser -v /dev/ttyACM0` shows who has it |
| `[error] {"msg": "unknown command", …}`       | Typo, or a dash before the command | Type the bare command, e.g. `expr happy`, not `-expr happy`                     |
| Settings like `bright` or `lcdcfg` were lost | The board rebooted                 | Retype them, or set defaults in `idf.py menuconfig`                               |
| Screen dark, faint glow, or blank              | Poor ground, or a separate supply without a shared ground | Check GND is firmly connected. Any separate LCD supply must share ground with the ESP32. Then check BL (GPIO 21) and VCC |
| Backlight on but no image                        | SPI data wiring                    | Check DIN (GPIO 11), CLK (12), CS (10), DC (13)                                     |
| Wrong colors or position                         | Panel settings                     | Run `lcdtest`, adjust with `lcdcfg` (see Face and display commands)             |
| Nothing but garbage from the CLI                 | Wrong baud rate                    | The robot uses 921600 since M3. Update the firmware, or pass `--baud 115200` to talk to old firmware |
| `beep` is silent                                 | Amp wiring or volume               | Check BCLK (GPIO 4), LRC (5), DIN (6), VIN on 5V, and the speaker on the amp's + / − terminals. Try `vol 80` |
| Speech has gaps, or `dropouts` goes up           | The PC couldn't keep up            | Close other programs using the port or CPU and retry. `say.py` reports dropouts at the end |
| `record.py` says all zeros                       | Mic not wired, or wired wrong      | Check VDD on 3V3, SCK (GPIO 15), WS (16), SD (17), and L/R on GND |
| `record.py` reports gaps, or `mic_overruns` goes up | The link or PC fell behind      | Close other programs using the port or CPU and retry |
| Board resets on loud sounds                      | Speaker drawing too much power     | Lower `vol`, or power the amp from a separate 5 V supply that shares GND with the ESP32 |
